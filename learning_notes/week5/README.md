## 🎯 Key Learnings

### 1. Automation Hierarchy
```
Level 1: One-off Script
Level 2: Reusable Function
Level 3: Composable System  ← Aim for this!
Level 4: Self-Improving
```

### 2. The Three Questions
Before any automation, ask:
1. What's the bottleneck?
2. What's the leverage point?
3. How to compound value?

### 3. Multi-Agent Coordination
- Use git worktrees for isolation
- Define clear ownership
- Share contracts, not implementation
- Design for failure recovery

## 📊 Progress
