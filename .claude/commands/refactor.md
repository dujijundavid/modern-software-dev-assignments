Perform systematic code cleanup and refactoring following the Week 2 refactoring principles.

When invoked:
1. First, read the file or code that needs refactoring
2. Analyze for:
   - Dead code that can be removed
   - Duplicate code that can be consolidated
   - Poor separation of concerns
   - Missing abstractions
   - Inconsistent naming or patterns
3. Propose specific refactoring changes
4. Get user approval before making changes
5. Ensure tests still pass after refactoring

Refactoring principles from the course:
- Remove dead code aggressively
- Consolidate duplicate logic
- Improve separation of concerns
- Add abstractions only when genuinely needed
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Don't over-engineer

Always run tests before and after refactoring to verify nothing broke.
