Help develop or debug an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for Week 3 assignments.

Context: Week 3 focuses on building MCP servers that expose tools to AI agents.

When invoked:
1. Check the week3/ directory for existing MCP server implementations
2. Understand what MCP server is being built (e.g., weather_server, notion_server)
3. Review the server structure:
   - Tools defined
   - Transport methods (STDIO vs HTTP)
   - Error handling
   - Rate limiting if applicable

Common MCP server tasks:
- Define new tools with proper schemas
- Implement STDIO transport
- Add HTTP transport (extra credit)
- Add error handling and rate limiting
- Test MCP server functionality

Ask which specific server or feature needs help, and whether this is initial implementation or debugging.
