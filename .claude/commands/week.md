You are working on the CS146S Modern Software Developer course. The user wants help with a specific weekly assignment.

First, understand which week they're working on by reviewing the context of their request. Then:

1. Review the week's assignment requirements in the corresponding week/ directory
2. Check learning_notes/ for relevant concepts and techniques
3. Understand what's already implemented vs what needs to be done
4. Provide guidance or implementation help appropriate for that week's focus

Weekly Focus Areas:
- Week 1: Prompting techniques (K-shot, CoT, RAG, etc.)
- Week 2: LLM-powered web apps with FastAPI (Action Item Extractor)
- Week 3: MCP Server development (Weather API, etc.)
- Week 4: Claude Code automation (slash commands, CLAUDE.md)
- Week 5: Warp multi-agent workflows
- Week 6: Security with Semgrep
- Week 7: AI code review with Graphite Diamond
- Week 8: Multi-stack development (3 different tech stacks)

Always ask clarifying questions if the week or specific task isn't clear.
