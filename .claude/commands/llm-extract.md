Help implement or improve LLM-based extraction functionality for the Action Item Extractor (Week 2).

Context: The week2/ directory contains an action item extractor that processes free-form notes and extracts structured action items.

When invoked:
1. Check the current implementation in week2/
2. Review the extraction service and related code
3. Understand what needs improvement or implementation
4. Focus on:
   - Prompt engineering for better extraction
   - Structured output parsing
   - Error handling and edge cases
   - Test coverage

Key files to review:
- week2/app/api/endpoints/extract.py
- week2/app/services/extractor.py or similar
- week2/tests/ directory

Ask clarifying questions about what specifically needs help:
- Adding new extraction features?
- Improving accuracy?
- Fixing bugs?
- Adding tests?
