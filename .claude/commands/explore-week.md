Use the Explore subagent to thoroughly investigate and analyze the current state of a specific weekly assignment.

Launch the Explore agent with these instructions:

"Explore the week{{ WEEK_NUMBER }} directory thoroughly to understand:
1. What files and structure already exist
2. What implementation is complete
3. What tests exist and their coverage
4. What's incomplete or TODO items
5. Any issues, bugs, or areas needing attention

Provide a comprehensive status report with specific file paths and line numbers where relevant."

Replace {{ WEEK_NUMBER }} with the actual week number, or ask the user which week they want to explore.
