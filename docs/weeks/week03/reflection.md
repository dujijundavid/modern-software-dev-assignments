  - Confidence level: To be documented

- **[Modern Python Tooling]**: uv package manager and project structure
  - How I applied it: Initialized project with uv, managed dependencies
  - Resources that helped: uv documentation, pyproject.toml reference
  - Confidence level: To be documented

### AI Engineering Concepts
- **[Protocol Standardization]**: MCP's role in unifying AI-agent tool integration
  - Real-world application: Building reusable tools that work across different AI platforms
  - Connection to course themes: Addresses "AI Engineering bottleneck" of fragmented tool ecosystems

- **[Tool-Use Pattern]**: Dynamic tool selection and execution by AI agents
  - Real-world application: Multi-step workflows like "check weather, then create calendar event"
  - Connection to course themes: Core mechanism for autonomous AI agents

- **[Graceful Degradation]**: Designing systems that fail gracefully

- [ ] Document technical skills learned and confidence levels
- [ ] Reflect on AI engineering concepts and their applications
- [ ] Describe automations built and systems thinking insights
- [ ] Analyze mistakes and lessons learned
- [ ] Record time allocation and variances
- [ ] Assess code, documentation, and learning quality
- [ ] Identify next steps and unresolved questions
- [ ] Connect work to course themes and automation hierarchy
